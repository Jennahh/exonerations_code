Jennah Haque



What the project does:
This is a project that estimates the effect of mandatory minimum sentencing reform on racial disparities within the number of exonerations. 

Why the project is useful:
This paper could provide insights to prosecutors/judges/policymakers on whether rolling back mandatory minimum sentencing laws might actually make criminal justice and our incarceration system more equitable. 

How users can get started with the project:
I recommend reading the paper with my findings and visiting the National Registry of Exonerations for more info about their dataset.

Where users can get help with your project:
